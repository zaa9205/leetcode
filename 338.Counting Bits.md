# Counting Bits (Medium)

**Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.**

**Example:
For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].**

**Follow up:**

**It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.**

Solution 1 - using Integer.bitCount(i) in Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        int[] ans = new int[num + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= num; i ++) {
            ans[i] = Integer.bitCount(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Solution 2 - the solution can be transfer to  ans[i] = ans[i / 2] + i % 2.
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] countBits(int num) {
        int[] ans = new int[num + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= num; i ++) {
            ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + i % 2;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
