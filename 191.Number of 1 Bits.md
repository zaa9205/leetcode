# Number of 1 Bits (Easy)

**Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).**

**For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.**

Solution 1 - find every bit in binary n

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int ans = 0;
        while (n != 0) { //we can also use "for (int i = 0; i < 32; i ++)", but for loop is slower than while
            ans += n & 1;
            n >>>= 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

Solution 2 - using method in Java Integer.bitCount(n);
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        return Integer.bitCount(n);
    }
}
```
