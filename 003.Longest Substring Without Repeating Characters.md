# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  (Medium)

**Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.**

**Examples:**

**Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.**

**Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.**

**Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.**

Have to use two index i j, to gurantee the characters betwen s.charAt(i) and s.charAt(j) are all different.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> alpha = new HashMap<>();
        int ans = 0, i = 0, j = 0, current = 0;
        
        while (i < s.length() && j < s.length()) {
            if (!alpha.containsKey(s.charAt(j))) {
                alpha.put(s.charAt(j), j);
                ans = Math.max(ans, j - i + 1);
                j ++;
            }
            else {              
                alpha.remove(s.charAt(i));
                i ++;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```
