# Trapping Rain Water

Solution 1 - Brute Force

Do as directed in question. For each element in the array, we find the maximum level of water it can trap after the rain, which is equal to the minimum of maximum height of bars on both the sides minus its own height.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        int ans = 0, j = 0;
        
        if (height.length <= 2) return ans;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < height.length - 1; i ++) {
            int max_left = 0, max_right = 0; // every loop the value of max_left and max_right should be back to 0;
            for (j = i; j >= 0; j --) {
                max_left = Math.max(height[j], max_left);
            }
            
            for (j = i; j < height.length; j ++) {
                max_right = Math.max(height[j], max_right);
            }
            
            if (Math.min(max_left, max_right) - height[i] > 0) {
                ans += Math.min(max_left, max_right) - height[i];
            }
            
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
