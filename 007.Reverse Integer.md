# Reverse Integer (Easy)

Related to 190.Reverse Bits: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/description/

**Reverse digits of an integer.**

**Example1: x = 123, return 321;
Example2: x = -123, return -321**

**Have you thought about this?
Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!**

**If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.**

**Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?**

**For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.**

**Note:
The input is assumed to be a 32-bit signed integer. Your function should return 0 when the reversed integer overflows.**

Solution 1 - decide whether the anwer is overflow after the reverse has done. Attention, for this situation, we need use set the anwer as long!! 
```java
public class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        long ans = 0; //ans必须是long, 因为不确定reverse后是否会越界
        int unit = 0;
        
        while (x != 0) {
            unit = x % 10;
            ans = ans * 10 + unit;
            x = x/10;
        }          
        if (ans > Integer.MAX_VALUE || ans < Integer.MIN_VALUE) {
                return 0;
        }
        else return (int)ans;
    }
}
```

Solution 2 - decide the overflow when reversing.
```java
public class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        int ans = 0, currentans = 0, unit = 0;
        
        while ( x != 0) {
            unit = x % 10;
            currentans = currentans * 10 + unit;
            if ( currentans / 10 != ans)
                return 0;
            ans = currentans;
            x = x / 10;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
