# Single Number (Easy)

**Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.**

**Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?**

Solution - XOR (Same with 268.Missing Number https://github.com/zaa9205/leetcode/blob/master/268.Missing%20Number.md)
```java
public class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i ++) {
            ans = ans ^ nums[i];
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```
