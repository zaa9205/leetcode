# Power of Three (Easy)

**Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.**

Solution 1 - 3^x = n, if number n is power of three, the x should be integer. Attention, we can NOT use log3(n) because in the java there is no Math.log3(n).
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return (Math.log10(n) / Math.log10(3)) % 1 == 0 ? true : false;
    }
}
```
